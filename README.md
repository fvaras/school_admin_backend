# school_admin_backend
This backend project is designed to support a comprehensive frontend for school administrations, facilitating a variety of operations. The API utilizes .NET Core 6.0, EF (Entity Framework), and Dapper, known for their robustness, security, and scalability, thereby ensuring a reliable foundation for school management systems.

## Notes:
For the scaffolding of interfaces, services, data access layer, DTOs and mapping profiles I used ChatGPT 4 with a prompt that generates all of this from a Model definition.

## Important
Currently, the project is in the design phase. However, I have made it public so that you can view my work and progress.
